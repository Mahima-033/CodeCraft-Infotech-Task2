Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning on the Titanic Dataset

This project involves a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the iconic Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover the hidden patterns and factors that influenced survival, by performing rigorous data cleaning and investigating the relationships between variables like class, gender, age, and fare.

# Key Steps & Insights:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns using appropriate imputation strategies.

Univariate Analysis: Explored the distribution of individual variables (e.g., survival rate, passenger class, age distribution).

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis: Investigated key relationships, such as:

The strong correlation between gender and survival ("Women and children first").

The impact of passenger class (Pclass) on survival chances and fare.

How age interacted with class and survival.

Visualization: Utilized a variety of plots including histograms, bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps to communicate findings effectively.

This deep dive highlights how EDA is a critical first step before any predictive modeling, transforming raw data into meaningful stories.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
